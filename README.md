# homemon-server
This project contains the server-side code for homemon. It has two purposes: first, it receives reports from a device with [homemon-daemon](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/homemon-daemon) and stores them in a database for further analysis. Second, it's able to display a web UI from that data, allowing a user to check on the status of their home and see details about the most recent reports.

Note that this can only receive reports from [homemon-daemon](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/homemon-daemon)'s HTTP transport. If you want to use the UDP transport, you'll need to set up [homemon-receiver](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/homemon-receiver). (which can write its reports in the same database as this program, meaning you're still able to use this program's UI)
